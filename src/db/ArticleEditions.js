                'Text': '<para>Introduction**Most schools are not allowing in-person schooling, so many teens have to learn online. Online schooling may be more difficult for many students, but it is much safer than going back on campus. However, many students are constantly distracted during online schooling and are not as focused as they should be in order to perform at the highest potential in their classes. This article will provide five tips on how to survive online schooling and perform at the highest potential.<para>#1: Become Distraction-Free**Sleeping and studying are two different activities. Do not associate your bed with working. This will warrant you to slack off, sleeping rather than studying or doing homework or paying attention in class. Have a separate place for schooling and a separate place for relaxing. By doing so, you will be more focused.<para>Okay, so you are now working in a different spot from where you relax. Perhaps at a desk or even a different room rather than a bed. This is the first step. The second part is to get rid of anything extraneous. Although this may be hard to do, put your phone away. Do not have it next to your desk unless you need to use it for class. Have it charging across the room, so you can still hear the phone if someone is calling you, but it is too far away that you would get easily distracted. Now, get rid of anything on the desk that you do not need so you do not get distracted. Also, try to find a quiet place to study and do homework. This way you will not have much noise to interrupt you while working. Good! You are now slightly more productive in school.<para>#2: Build Up Good Habits**Habits are essential. They get you through your everyday life. As Octavia Butler, an American science fiction author, once said, “First forget inspiration. Habit is more dependable. Habit will sustain you whether you’re inspired or not.” This means that with good habits, anything is possible.<para>In order to make habits, you must know how to. First, make a cue—for instance, waking up. Then, do the routine—brushing your teeth. Finally, get your reward—a nice clean smile. You can implement this with anything, whether it be in school or your own life. For example, a productive habit could be when you finish school (cue), you start on your homework for the day right away (routine), resulting in you finishing all your homework for the day, so you do not have to stress about it anymore (reward). Make your own habits, and make them stick by doing them every day.<para>#3: Stay on Track**In class, make sure to pay attention. Your phone may be tempting because no one would discipline you for being on it, but do not fall into this trap. Habits are easy to make, whether they are good or bad. You do not want to create a bad habit of being constantly distracted in class. Change this by putting your phone across the room when you are in school. In addition, make sure your desk is cleared from any miscellaneous items that could distract you (rule #1). Each time you want to get distracted, stop yourself. By doing this, you strengthen your self-discipline, making it slightly easier to refocus the next time you want to get distracted.<para>#4: Be Prepared**When in school, have all your tools ready. Have your laptop charged, have your pencil and notebook nearby, and anything else you may need for that specific class. In addition, have plenty of water nearby because your brain works better when hydrated. Use your break time for bathroom breaks. Have everything on standby and ready to attend class on time.<para>#5: Do something Productive Every Day**Do something that makes you a better person today than you were yesterday. As James Clear, author of “Atomic Habits”, wrote, “Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.” If we put this into numbers, and you get one percent better every day, this will compound into 3778% better by the end of the year—37 times better than last year.<para>Every day, do something that is productive, regardless of how small it is. Whether it be reading an article before you sleep, doing homework, studying for 15 minutes, or practicing an instrument, you can do anything to become a better person the next day than you are at this moment. Get into the habit of being productive every day and you will see your improvement.<para>Conclusion**Now that you finished reading this article, make sure to implement what you learn. Passively consuming productivity content (such as this) only stimulates your brain that you are being productive. The only way to actually be productive is by implementing productivity into your life and being proactive about how you learn. Take these tips and apply them to your life!<para>'

During the month of September, you can see Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and other Latin American countries all celebrate with their own unique traditions, from dances to music, speeches from leaders, food, fireworks, and so much more. The next day on September 16th Hispanics has Mexico Independence Day as Miguel Hidalgo issued “Grito de Dolores” in 1820. Miguel Hidalgo known as Father Hidalgo was the first to lead Mexico’s rebellion with his “Cry of Dolores. In addition, Chile also celebrates its Independence on the 18th of September.<para>During Hispanic Heritage Month, the United States Army and Navy honor their fallen and active soldiers and sailors. On September 14, 2020, President Donald Trump said in a Proclamation on National Hispanic Heritage Month, “Hispanic Americans embody the best of our American values, including commitment to faith, family, and country. They serve in our military and protect us as members of law enforcement. In fact, Hispanic Americans make up half of our Border Patrol agents. The Hispanic-American community has left an indelible mark on our government, culture, and economy.” Over the past thirty years, the representation of Hispanic-Americans on active duty has increased by ten percent.<para>/Edition1Imgs/soldiers.jpg**Soldiers relax at a luncheon held in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month in September 2010 at Contingency Operating Base Speicher, near Tikrit, Iraq.Image Credits: The American Mosaic: The Latino American Experience, ABC-CLIO, 2021<para>Annual Events**sub-string<para>dotted*li*In Springdale, Holyoke, Massachusetts the Hispanic Family festival is held annually.*li*In 2013 the Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce established an annual Northwest Arkansas Hispanic Heritage Festival.*li*In Tumacacori, Arizona, “La Fiesta de Tumacacori,” is held in December to celebrate the diverse cultures and traditions of the Arizona borderlands.*li*In New York City Hispanic Day Parade takes place on Fifth Avenue the Sunday before or after Columbus Day to celebrate the last few days of Hispanic Heritage Month.*li*The Arizonan Diamondbacks’ held an annual Hispanic Heritage Day street festival with Mariachi performers, ballet Folklorico dances, food, piñatas, and so much more.*li*<para>Annual festivals are held everywhere in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, with beautiful traditions and delicious foods from Hispanic/Latin countries.

                'Text': "<para>Introduction**Does your phone always seem to run out of batteries? Well, your problems will be a thing of the past after you implement these ways to save battery life on your phone! After using your phone heavily with tasks that need a few more processes like watching a video or playing games, you start to notice that you lose more battery life. This can be a problem for many as we often use our phone to keep track of what's going on, with things we are connected to such as events with friends or family or with digital work. Of course, the simple solution to this would be bringing the charger with you; however, chargers are portable, but outlets are not. It is usually troublesome to find an outlet. So this leaves us with the following options on how to conserve our battery so that it lasts longer throughout the day.<para>/Edition1Imgs/dark-mode.webp**Dark Mode On IPhone<para>Dark Mode/Brightness**With the new appearance of dark mode coming out for practically every device we use, iPhones, Android phones, and computers. This mode came with the purpose of two cases, to help with usage in the night to help with the comfort of the eyes and to save battery life. However, the big change in battery only comes from phones or computers with OLED screens but has a major effect. As stated by Ifixit, a trusted repair company, “Each OLED pixel generates its own light, while LCD screens light all pixels from the edges. OLED pixels that are black draw no power, and are closer to pitch-black than LCD screens, which draw the same amount of power whether they’re displaying an all-white image or an all-black one.” This really only helps with OLED screens; but what about those with LCD screens which a majority of devices have? Well for those with LCD screens, dark modes won’t help much; however, the brightness does help. The LCD and OLED screens get a huge impact on brightness as it will show less light saving more power for the device.<para>/Edition1Imgs/app-switcher.jpg**IPhone App Switcher<para>Background Tasks**Phones are known to be able to multitask for a while now, this was made for the user to be able to switch between apps without having to reload the whole app too often. This, however, can cause a problem on its own if you are not planning to use your phone within the next 30 minutes it can cause battery consumption as the whole app will be running in your background taking resources in your phone to use the battery. However, this does not mean that when you close an app you should go and close it completely using the multitasking page. This is a flaw for many as reopening your apps a bunch of times around the same time can end up using more battery than keeping it open for a few minutes.<para>/Edition1Imgs/airplane-mode.jpg**IPhone Airplane Mode<para>Airplane Mode/GPS**This sacrifice is only made to be used when you do not need your phone as it does make many features of your phone unusable. Airplane mode will shut off all of your wireless connections such as wifi, Bluetooth, and cellular data. However, the problem with shutting off these toggles is you won’t be able to go online and connect to any Bluetooth accessories while airplane mode is on. In addition, Gps does not get turned off while you turn on airplane mode, the GPS toggle makes it so that your device can send location data that your apps may need. As for all of these settings they use battery life in the background because they need to refresh every couple of seconds to check for any new connections or to send or receive data. Turning on airplane mode and turning off GPS can save you a substantial amount of battery life; however, it is recommended to do this while sleeping or any other times you won’t need your phone.<para>/Edition1Imgs/notifications.jpg**IPhone Notifications<para>Reduce Push Notifications**Notifications are the little pop-ups at the top of your screen or in your lock screen. These are here to alert you of certain activities within the app; however, this may be a problem as your phone has to refresh and find notifications coming from those apps to send them out to the user. This can use battery life and if turned on you may save yourself an hour or two. The user might have a problem with the need for a certain notification of a number of apps. However, with the newest versions of Windows, IOS, and Android, you have the option to turn off notifications from a certain app. Turning off this setting for a certain app is pretty similar for all devices<para>numbered*li*Open settings*li*Look for the notification setting*li*Look for the app that you don't need notifications from*li*tap/click on the app and turn off its notifications access<para>Just like that, you can save battery life by simply turning off possibly annoying alerts that come out of your phone.<para>Conclusion**Although batteries might be aging in your phone you can make the most out of it. These tips of tricks of turning off and on settings will surely use less battery life in the phone, resulting in more phone use. Getting the most out of a phone is really important as they are a part of our everyday lives that help us send messages, call and socialize.

You love adventure and you’re full of energy. You wouldn’t want anyone to rain on your parade right? Well if so, Cancers are not for you. When it comes to dealing with emotions, Aries tends to be blunt, ruthless if you will, while Cancers are the exact opposite. They are sensitive and emotional. These two signs can clash due to Cancer’s mood swings and Aries’ aggression. So, these two must be kept far from each other. Not to worry though, there is a sign that is very similar to your personality traits: Aquarius! *cue angelic halo music* These two are anything but dull. Together they are creative, competitive, and have excellent communication. Whether you are friends or something more than friends with an Aquarius, you are sure to have a great time with them, regardless.<para>Taurus**/Edition2Imgs/tarus.webp**As a Taurus, the bull sign, you are calm and level-headed but also very determined. You know what you want and when you want it. With that being said, say hello to your best friend, Cancer. Both of these signs are nurturers and are very into looking out for each other. They are very simple people and find joy in the quiet, relaxing moments. So all my Taurus people, get yourself a Cancer! Now for the bad part. Taurus’ should steer clear from Aquarius’. Well not completely, pull that car in reverse! When put on the same page, Taurus and Aquarius can do great things, so this is more of a friendship than a relationship. Both have that need to succeed which can help reach a common goal, but both are also extremely opinionated. This trait can bring several arguments even for the slightest things. When they are filled with anger, a Taurus will tackle their anger head on while an Aquarius pulls away, avoiding the situation. This causes a toxic, dominant relationship between the two. You know what, put that car back in drive, hit the gas and don’t look back! Well, not that harsh.<para> Gemini **/Edition2Imgs/gemini.png **Ah yes, the twin sign. You are described as valuing love and intelligence over everything. You enjoy a nice, interesting debate with others and you too, have creative, unique thoughts. Listen here Geminis; I might have found your “twin” sign: Libra. These signs match due to their mental agility and value of intellectual interests. Creativity strikes both signs which means the possibilities of hang-out ideas are endless. So run to the store or ask Santa for that special Libra. Now Geminis, you know no one can ruin that spunky, free-minded spirit of yours… except for Virgos. This being that Virgos have a serious mentality and think that life should be all work, no play which is the complete opposite of Geminis. Geminis tend to express their love more openly and in numerous ways but this can be hard for Virgos. Virgos are intimate and they don’t really express their love very well. Both of these factors often cause clashes between Geminis and Virgos, but they say opposites attract right?<para> Cancer ** /Edition2Imgs/cancer.png** Greetings Cancers of the world! You, the crab sign, are classified as being kind, generous, and caring. You are there for others and are often the shoulder to cry on in your friend group because you love to nurture others. Well Cancers, meet your match: Pisces! Both these signs value kindness and look for happiness. Pisces are very selfless which makes for a great person to have a relationship with. Be careful though, Libras don’t click with Cancers. Reason being that Libras try to see the good in everyoneand everything which isn’t good when Libras are put between two people. So, if a Cancer were to get in a conflict with another person, Libras would try to see both sides of a story which would annoy a Cancer. Since Cancers and Libras don’t have big differences, these two can move mountains if they can communicate well.<para> Leo **/Edition2Imgs/leo.png**Now for the Lion sign, Leo. Leos are the “it” sign; they are the center of attention due to their immense enthusiasm and outgoingness. They provide fun times and are very creative and wild. Basically, anything but boring. What better match for the spunky, unique Leo than a Sagittarius. With these two together, nothing can go wrong because of their similar personalities. Both love to have fun and live life to the fullest. This will bring a relationship with nothing but happiness and respect for each other. Now not everything in life will be sunshine and rainbows, especially when a Leo meets a Scorpio. A relationship with these two will definitely bring some conflicts considering Scorpios tend to be stubborn and dominant mindset. This leadsto arguments since Scorpios will not admit their wrongs and will try to control free-spirited Leo.<para> Virgo**/Edition2Imgs/virgo.png **This earth sign is said to be very critical, picky, and overall serious, but only because they look to help others. They enjoy knowing they are needed and that they are efficient. Characteristics like these are good indications for one sign: Taurus. A relationship between Taurus’ and Virgos is bound to work out since both have a need for being useful. They also both have a very determined mentality which is great when they come together to work towards a common goal. Since both signs are similar, they respect each other and understand each other’s values. So come on you determined sign, look high and low for a Taurus. While on that search for a Taurus, you might want to avoid a Sagittarius. You might be asking why, but it is all quite clear. A serious and perfectionist person, Virgo, does not mesh well with a cheerful, laid-back person, Sagittarius.<para> Libra **/Edition2Imgs/libra.png ** Libras are a selfless sign considering they look out for others. They also rarely like being alone so they would never mind some company. Therefore, any sign would be a good match, but the BEST match would be a Gemini. Geminis, too, look out for others and understand them which is essentially a recipe for a good partnership. On the other hand, Libras aren’t the best when matched with a Capricorn. Capricorns are calm, quiet, and they keep to themselves which is different to the social butterfly that is a Libra. Lastly, these two wouldn’t work out due to Capricorns being more like a manager than a partner since Libras are unselfish.<para>Scorpio**/Edition2Imgs/scorpio.png **Scorpios are incredibly curious when it comes to aspects about the world and people they meet. When meeting a new person, Scorpios like to get down business and ask interesting, meaningful questions. Similar to them is Cancer who provides love and care, making them a good match. Scorpios and Cancers click in a relationship because they are both intense when it comes to showing emotions. Both signs enjoy being around others which makes for a strong relationship where both partners understand each other’s values. Of course not every sign will get along great, but especially not Scorpios and Aquarius’. Scorpios are intense and very affectionate when it comes to partners but Aquarius is the opposite. An Aquarius isn’t into emotions which will cause a conflict of interest in the bond.<para>Sagittarius**/Edition2Imgs/sagittarius.png ** This fire sign is anything but oblivious. They like to get to the bottom of things. They are interested in philosophies and value the aspect of knowledge. Similar to a Sagittarius is none other than an Aries. These two are the definition of a dynamic duo, to others and the world they inhabit, with their enthusiastic and intrigued selves. A strong relationship is sure to happen when a Sagittarius and Aries cross paths. On the contrary, Sagittarius and Pisces don’t have an unbreakable bond like an Aries and Sagittarius do. Pisces tend to be very indecisive so when a Sagittarius is determined to get answers, a Pisces will provide different alternatives which might not always be what their partner wants.<para> Capricorn ** /Edition2Imgs/capricorn.png ** The tenth zodiac sign, Capricorn, is centered around work 24/7. They are also competitive which makes them work that much harder so they can be the best. Success is what they value most as well as determination and to have goals in one’s life. The perfect partner for these hard-workers are Virgos. Both of these signs enjoy working and strive to be efficient. This will bring the relationship a great deal of respect. Since both signs have very similar values, they will be understanding towards one another. In contrast, a Taurus and Capricorn aren’t the best match. You may be thinking, aren’t they both determined as well? That is true, but they are determined in different aspects. Taurus is determined in love and relationships while a Capricorn focuses on work and career. Capricorns may think that Tauruses are lazy due to their calmness and Tauruses will think Capricorns are too stuck up. All that equals a recipe for disaster.<para>Aquarius**/Edition2Imgs/aquarius.png **The air sign is all about problem solving and changing how things are. Aquarius’ love spending time thinking about how things can be better in the world and in their life. Listen up Aquarius’, if you want to better your life, then find yourself a Gemini. Both signs bond over new ideas and thoughts with their creative, imaginative minds. Because an Aquarius is so full of life, it might be a good idea to avoid a Virgo. Virgos are strictly “work thoughts only” so talking to them about the crazy, brilliant thoughts that go through an Aquarius’ mind might bore or annoy a Virgo. We all know it’s not a good idea to be with someone who you don’t share interests with, so Aquarius’, you know what to do.<para>Pisces**/Edition2Imgs/pisces.png **Last but certainly not least is the fish sign, Pisces. As a Pisces, you are described as selfless, happy, and focused on growing as a person. Based on that your ideal partner is a Scorpio who like you is also focused on one’s inner journey. Both of these signs are interested in getting to know each other, forming a strong and stable bond. This Pisces-Scorpio relationship is different from the one a Pisces and Gemini have. These two signs are not the best for each other considering that Gemini often says what is on their mind, sometimes without analyzing first. This could lead to some major and minor conflicts but nothing a Pisces and Gemini can’t solve.<para>",

Although in today’s society, both New Years are relatively similar and are celebrated on the same day, they are not exactly the same. Each Asian New Year is slightly different in its own ways. According to Chúc Bùi, a UCLA lecturer in Vietnamese, “There’s a common misconception that China was the first to celebrate Lunar New Year when Vietnam had already begun observing the holiday over 4,000 years ago. In the next 4,000 years, Vietnam and China would influence each other in their traditions and customs.”<para>Background Knowledge**Traditionally, the Vietnamese Lunar New Year occurs on the first new moon of the lunar calendar and ends on the first full moon of the lunar calendar (which takes 15 days to happen). This can occur anywhere between January 21st and February 20th according to the Western calendars. In 2021, this New Year is starting on Friday, February 12, 2021. Vietnamese Lunar New Year has many names such as Spring Festival and Tết Nguyên Đán (which is Sino-Vietnamese for “Feast of the First Morning of the First Day”). However, it is most commonly known by the Vietnamese as “Tết .”<para>What are the Traditions of Vietnamese Lunar Year?**The plentiful traditions of Tết can be separated into 3 categories: before Tết, during Tết, and after Tết. Rest assured though, each tradition is just as culturally important than the next.<para> BEFORE TẾT**Before even celebrating the start of the new year, Vietnamese people around the globe first prepare for this holiday by cleaning their houses and cooking special foods that are common during this special period. For example, a Vietnamese New Year celebration cannot be complete without Bánh Tết, which literally translates to “Tết Cake.” Bánh Tết is a glutenous Vietnamese rice cake that is filled with mung bean and/or pork, wrapped into a cylindrical log with banana leaves, and boiled for 6-8 hours. Another example of unique Vietnamese New Year foods is Canh Khổ Qua Dồn Thịt which translates to “Bitter Melon Stuffed With Meat Soup.” This food is hated by some for its bitterness, but loved by much more.<para>/Edition2Imgs/banh-tet.png**Bánh Tết<para>/Edition2Imgs/canh-kho.webp**Canh Khổ Qua Dồn Thịt<para>DURING TẾT**The true meaning of Tết is to spend time with loved ones while also hoping for good fortune in the new year. Vietnamese families will bring yummy foods to their relatives, light incense at the shrines of their ancestors, and visit temples to pray to the gods that a good year is upon them. Sometimes, more traditional vietnamese families will dress up in traditional Vietnamese clothing called an “áo dài” which are long silk tunics that have matching headpieces. Last, but certainly not least, we can’t forget about lì xì! Lì xì, commonly known as “red pocket money” are small red envelopes decorated with golden designs of the year’s animal (2021 is the year of the Ox) and given to younger family members as lucky money. This is probably Vietnamese children’s favorite part of the Lunar New Year, but as you get older, you stop receiving money and are expected to start giving it! Oh how the tables turn.<para>/Edition2Imgs/ao-dai.png**Áo Dài<para>/Edition2Imgs/li-xi.png**Lì Xì!<para> AFTER TẾT**After 15 days, Tết ends, but festivals and activities still take place. In Vietnam, people participate in buffalo fighting festivals, boat racing, wrestling, and lion or dragon dances. These last for a month after Tết ends. The Vietnamese create invaluable memories here in the New Year, which they will treasure for the rest of their lives.<para>/Edition2Imgs/dragon-festival.png**Dragon Dance on Tết Festival<para>/Edition2Imgs/boat-racing.png**Boat Racing<para>',

I feel she was just passionate about living before she met Joe. SHe couldn't find anything to enjoy, but, with Joe, she realized there's a lot more.' That's the great thing about this movie's perspective. I originally answered these questions differently to Irais, when asked 'What was your mindset after the movie?'

I answered with 'I have felt that way before; it's freally about trying new things and seeling new experiences.'

What few knows is why Presidnets' Day became a holiday. Presidnets' Day dates back to after America's first president, George Washington, passed away on December 14, 1799. President's day was first known as 'Washington's Birthday' because it took place on February 22, 1800 as a day of remembrance for President Washington. This date was an unofficial holiday until 1879 when President Rutherford B. Hayes signed it into law. Washingont's Birthday only applied to the District of Columbia at first but then axpanded to all of the United States. However, later in 1968, during a debate to change several federal holidays to be on a Monday (called the Uniform Monday Holiday Act), the idea of changing the holiday name from Washington's Birthday to President's Day was proposed because President Lincoln's birthday was also in February. Changing the holiday's name would not only honor President Lincoln and Washington but all other presidents as well but Congress rejected the new name. It wasn't until 1971 that the day we so commonly call as Presidents' Day was actually called Presidents' Day. This holiday is typically celebrated with public ceremonies that often take place across the country, but mainly in Washington D.C. Although this year's ceremonies might look different this year, it will be intresting to see what celebrations are hold considering we recently welcomed a new president in office. <para>",

Bake for 10 minutes or until the cookies have puffed up and cracked, but are still a little gooey in the center.*li*Allow to cool and enjoy with a glass of milk!<para>For the most part, this set of instructions is perfect but here are a few words of caution if you choose to try this recipe.<para>numbered*li*10 minutes at 350 degrees in my small oven seemed to be too hot/too long. My cookies still came out VERY yummy, but I would have liked them to be much more moist and brownie-like in the middle. If I were to do it again, I would either lower my oven temperature or bake them for maybe 8.5 minutes instead of 10.*li*When you cream the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together, make sure to whip the butter FIRST. The mistake I made was putting a softened stick of butter in a bowl, pouring all the sugar on top and trying to mux it that way. THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA! I was left with clips of uncombined butter and sugar that was nearly impossible to cream together. I ended up having to put the bowl (it was microwave-safe) in the microwave for 20 seconds to warm up the butter a little bit for easier incorporation. Save yourself the trouble and just whip the butter before adding any sugar.*li*If you choose to use my slightly adjusted version, simply add in the white vinegar as you add in the eggs.*li*Once you add your dry ingredients to your wet ingredients, don't be scared to add a LITTLE bit more flour if it seems too sticky. Your dough should still be tacky but if you press your finger into the dough very quickly, it should not stick and you should still be able to roll the dough into a ball if you work quickly.*li*There is a tip on the website that tells you to not chill your dough. I can't stress this enough! I may have added a tiny bit too much flour so the cookies didn't spread as much as I would have liked. That being said, try to flatten your balls before you bake them a little bit because they really don't spread all that much.*li*Finally, the recipe calls for the balls of dough to be rolled in granulated sugar and THEN in powdered sugar. I can’t recommend this enough! When you bite into the cookies, you get a little bit of crunch from the powdered sugar crust before you bite into the gooey center and it just makes it that much better.<para>That’s the end of my trial and error with this recipe, but honestly, these cookies were SO SO good. I brought them to a friends house and they were gone instantly! If you follow my tips, or even if you follow the original recipe step by step, you will not be disappointed by how good these cookies are. That being said, good luck if you try this! Here's a picture of how mine came out! :)<para>/Edition3Imgs/finished-cookies.jpg**Jenna Nguyen's Homemade Red Velvet Crinkle Cookies<para>",

                'Summary': 'One of the best ways to spend quarantine is by binging Netflix shows! There are so many good shows on Netflix, but which ones are really worth your time? These films are a must-watch for sure!',

                'Text': "<para>Netflix Shows to Check Out**As many of us know, quarantine has been a very stressful time. Some of us have all the time in the world, but don’t know what to do. So, here’s a small list of Netflix shows you should binge and why they are listed by genre, duration, and a small description.<para>We Bare Bears**/Edition3Imgs/we-bare-bear.jpg**Cartoon Network TV Show: We Bare Bears Image Credits: Tony Puham: We Bare Bears. July 27, 2015.**We Bare Bears is a Cartoon Network TV Show, created by Daniel Chong, that consists of three different bears who live together in San Francisco, California.<para>Ice Bear are non-related brothers that have fun and wholesome adventures in every episode. They make friends like Chloe Park, a young introverted Korean girl and a problematic commercial celebrity Nom-Nom, who eventually warms up to them.<para>The Netflix version only consists of the first two seasons. Seasons three and four each have over 15 episodes, each running for 11 minutes, and can be watched on Hulu and Cartoon Network. This TV-Y show is a great and not time-consuming series that functions as a source of white noise while doing simple tasks. Or, you can fully binge the life of three wholesome bear brothers and their interactions with their Californian community.<para>Las Leyendas**/Edition3Imgs/leyendas.webp**Netflix Original: Las Leyendas Image Credits: Ricardo Arnaiz: Las Leyendas. February 2021.**The Netflix Original, Las Leyendas, is a TV-Y7 series following the life of a young Mexican boy named Leo San Juan and his three friends: Alebrije, San Andres, and Teodora. These four friends travel all around the world in order to find allies in their battle against Quetzacoatl, an Aztec deity who plans to destroy and renew the world. However, as they travel around the world they introduce urban legends like Baba Yaga, Medusa, Kaijus, and many more.<para>The Netflix series is another one of Anima Estudios’, a hispanic animation studio, great works of Leo San Juan. Many Latinos are familiar with their other works like La Leyenda de la Llorona(2011) or La leyenda del Charro Negro(2018). But, this specific series has only one season with 13 episodes, each being 25 minutes long. Not only is it such a fun and educating way to pass time, but for many Latinos, it’s a very nostalgic experience to see the supernatural investigation team back on screens.<para>Anne with an E**/Edition3Imgs/anne.jpg**TV Series: Anne With an E Image Credits: Anne Wheeler: Anne with an E. March 19, 2017.**Anne with an E is a TV series created by Moira Walley-Beckett, that follows the life of Anne, a young Canadian orphan who is adopted by elder siblings, Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, in the 19th century. The show starts off with her figuring out who she is, an outgoing new kid in town with radical ideas, while making life-long friends as well. The series is rated TV-PG, with mentions of serious topics like racism, sexism, sexuality, self-identity, and so much more.<para>The series consists of three seasons, with a total of 27 episodes, all being 44 minutes long. However, the first episode of season one is an hour long. This series is one of my top recommendations for those that are in love with cottagecore and environmental visuals, and amazing plot lines as well.It has drama, love, tension, and so much more. Anne has the characteristics of a young activist and poet who sees the world for more than what it is; she is a daydreamer that falls in love with the warm sceneries. It creates a sense of passion and love for the simple things like a nice sunset or a warm pastry.<para>Grand Army**/Edition3Imgs/grand-army.jpg**Netflix Original: Grand Army Image Credits: Katie Cappiello: Grand Army. October 16, 2020.**This Netflix Original series is a great choice! It is set in modern day New York, at the perspective of five high school students. It mainly focuses on Joey Del Marco and her life. Each student comes from a different background and the show does an amazing job at showing their experiences and differences. The show is rated TV-MA which means that it contains sexual activities, drugs, mental illnesses and trauma, racism, and other sensitive topics. Nonetheless, it does a great job at realistically portraying each aspect.<para>Unfortunately, the series only has one season with nine episodes, each being 50-60 minutes long. Fortunately,the 10 hours you’ll spend watching this worth it. Each episode gives exposure to how mental trauma makes people feel and its serious impact, people working day and night to help their low-income families, and figuring out your cultural-identity can be hard.<para>Sex Education**/Edition3Imgs/sex-education.jpg**TV Show: Sex Education Image Credits: Laurie Nunn: Sex Education. January 11, 2019.**Sex Education, by Laurie Nunn, is one of my favorite TV shows. It's based in England and follows the life of high schoolers. It mostly revolves around our protagonists Otis Milburn and Maeve Wiley who created a profitable sex education clinic in their school and come across various different stories, issues, and learn even more about different perspectives. However, with such a mature topic about sex education, the questions of being by yourself, sexuality, homophobia, and trauma are brought into question. It’s a TV-MA show with very explicit graphics.<para>The show itself runs for two seasons, each having eight episodes. The timespan for each episode is about 40-60 minutes. It’s an amazing TV show that isn’t afraid to show the passion, beauty, and awakradness of sex education.<para>Good Girls**/Edition3Imgs/good-girls.jpg**TV Series: Good Girls Image Credits: Jenna Bans: Good Girls. Feburary 26, 2018.**Good Girls is a TV- MA rated show created by Jenna Bans revolving around two sisters and their childhood friend that become criminals and work for a gang leader named Rio. Elizabeth, Annie, and Ruby are day-to-day housewives until they plan to rob a grocery store and accidently mess with a gang’s money laundering business. Over time, they decide to stay and become professional criminals using the money for financial struggles they have in their personal lives.<para>The show aired on NBC, but the Netflix version consists of three seasons and has a total of 24 episodes, each running for about 40-60 minutes. One of the best things about this show is the comedic sense that all the characters bring to the table, the soundtrack is an amazing work as well. The plotline complicates itself in such a mysterious and tense way that it creates an intriguing show. Truly a piece to binge watch.<para>"

After a long time of using your speakers, you might be able to tell that they got quieter than they were before. This is because gunk and lint go around your speakers which makes them quieter and sometimes unusable, so if you just brush where your speakers are at, then it should be able to remove the gunk. (I recommend not using your own toothbrush haha.)<para>/Edition3Imgs/iphone-uv-light.jpg**IPhone UV Light<para>Using UV Light**Using Uv light is actually the most expensive option to clean a phone but many people showed that it has great effects. Using Uv light can clean your phone from germs and any viruses, it won’t look clean, but if you are looking for a solution to kill germs, then this will work. This won’t get rid of smudge marks or oils, but it will not make your device look clean. If you are looking for a way to kill every single virus on your device with good results this is the way.<para>Conclusion**Now after following these tips your device should have become a lot cleaner than it was before. Although the UV light option might be a little expensive, it is not necessary to do that one as the other options work. As long as your phone doesn’t have any cracks or scratches your device should look as good as new. Especially around this time of Covid-19 we really need to start looking forward to cleaning our devices.<para>',
