                  Hello! My name is Ms. Pelagio and I teach US History. This is my 5th year teaching at Trevor 
                  Browne and 2nd in the Orange Juice. I love teaching AMerican Hisotry because it is the story 
                  of how our country camem to be. I have also enjoyed the past 2 years in newspaper because it's 
                  allowed me to get to know students in my class outside of that environment.

                  Hello! My name is Brian! :) First thing I would like to mention is that I'm a breed between 
                  white and Mexican so I guess you can say Whitexican? I love technology. I been thinking about 
                  inventions and thinking of ways to interact with technology itself. TOday, I find myself 
                  knowing alotttttt about technology with sometimes surprising myself with how much I know. 
                  I love anime, but I don't watch too much of it, however, because I like to also stay very 
                  productive as I leave my day with a whole schedule put in place.

                  making this website with the help of Steven Le. We both know about coding so we have both 
                  contributed to making this website. I hope this website gets to go far because we put lots

                  Hey everyone! I'm Jenna, a senior at TGB :). If you can picture a Vietnamese girl that's just 
                  over five feet and lvoes to get creative, then yuo would be picturing me! I love spending my 
                  free time painting, baking, or anything else that gets my gears turning. I dislike being bored 
                  haha. Other than my personal hobbies, I have played basketball since the 6th grade, and I'm even 
                  a part of TGB's varsity basketball team. Although I have played basketball for so long, I would 
                  have to say that Badminton is my favorite sport even though I've only played since sophomore year. 
                  Since becoming the varsity captain of TGB's badminton team during my junior year, I have led my 
                  team to two consecutive Metro Region Champions titles, and I am proud to be able to say that! 
                  I am an avid anime watcher if I do say so myself. Here are some of my anime-related achievements: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Watching every single episode of Naruto and Naruto Shippudent without skipping any fillers 
                  </li> 
                  <li>
                    Being over halfway done with One Piece 
                  </li> 
                  <li>
                    Being able to read subtitiles and actually watch the anime simultaneously! 
                  </li>
                </ul> 
                <p>
                  My all-time favorite anime is Haikyu with Hunter x Hunter coming in at a close second. I love 
                  meeting new people, so if you're reading this, and you see me in person, come talk to me! 
                  Hopefully, you've leared enough about me in this short biography that can instigate some type 
                  of conversation :). Until we meet again, reader...

                  how to make bios‚Ä¶ SO LET'S WING IT!!! (^_^‚Äô) I am Vietnamese-American, and I have been gaming 
                  since I was 5; I LOVE gaming. The first game I ever played was MapleStory, and I still visit 
                  that game every once in a while haha (pls tell me someone here played Maple too ;-;). Fun Fact: 
                  My personal statement was about video games! Right now, I‚Äôm playing quite a bit of League of 
                  Legends. I‚Äôm also a big anime fan. My favorite shows are Sword Art Online and Demon Slayer. 
                  I even finished the whole Demon Slayer Manga. Can‚Äôt wait till the movie comes out, so I can see 
                  it all animated!

                <p>
                  Oh yeah, I should probably talk about the Orange Juice News and my contributions to the club lmao. 
                  So I've been in the Orange Juice News since sophomore year, and I am currently a senior. I became 
                  the treasurer my junior year of high school. During my 11th to 12th-grade summer, I took the Brandeis 
                  App Design Pre-College program, where I learned about HTML and coding. This is where I got the 
                  necessary skills to start making this website. I hope you enjoyed what I started and I'm praying 
                  this continues on after my graduation!

                  Hey, what‚Äôs up! I‚Äôm Jair Carrizal, and you‚Äôre watching Disney channel. The first thing I would 
                  like to say is that I am a mix of Mexican and Philipino. I always had a passion for music, which 
                  has made me the odd one out of my family at times. One of the first CDs I ever owned was Drake's 
                  Thank Me Later album. Sometimes, I find myself writing lyrics randomly, and that's a gift that 
                  I just can't explain. I later fell in love with emo rap. One of my favorite artists is Sub 
                  Urban. I'm also a big fan of Matt Groening's shows The Simpsons, Disenchanted, and Futurama. 
                  I have probably spent too much time watching all of those shows, but I love the animation 
                  in each show.

                  I joined the Orange Juice News in September 2020, and I am a Junior. I originally joined 
                  because I liked writing, but things changed. I ended up being an illustrator... wait no 
                  an animator. Honestly, I don't know haha. I just draw stuff, so yeah! I ended up drawing 
                  the mascot, Ozzie, and I realized that I love drawing; So, now, I‚Äôm just working on more 
                  drawings and on a couple of articles! :D

                  Hi! My name is Irais, and I‚Äôm a sophomore. I‚Äôve been in the Newspaper since the start of 
                  the 2020 school year. I joined because I thought I could try a different form of writing 
                  rather than the essays most students do for their English class. I never really liked 
                  writing essays, but it turns out that I enjoy writing when I have the ability to choose 
                  my topic. Anyway, a little bit about me is that I love listening to music, and I love 
                  exploring new genres and finding out what other people like to listen to. I feel you 
                  can really get to know a person by their music taste. I also enjoy being on my phone 
                  as anyone would, especially playing games like Roblox and Minecraft (I‚Äôm not quite 
                  the gamiest though). I also like watching TV shows and movies. Some of my favorites 
                  are Stranger Things, Superbad, Mean Girls, and White Chicks. Another thing about me 
                  is that I enjoy drawing and coloring. Although I‚Äôm not the best at drawing, I like 
                  to display what‚Äôs on my mind on paper. Well, there‚Äôs really not that much to me as 
                  a person, so that‚Äôs all I can think of lol. :)
